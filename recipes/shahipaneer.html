    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>When we were kids, whenever my parents went out to an adults only party, my mother used to ask us what we wanted for dinner at home. 
        99% of the time, our choice was pooris and <b>shahi paneer</b>. My mother was always nice enough to oblige. 
        Here is the recipe. It is quite rich and hence a nice treat.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 tablespoons cooking oil

            <li>1 large onion, thinly sliced</li>
            
            <li>4 cloves garlic, minced</li>

            <li>1 teaspoon ground cumin</li>
            
            <li>1 teaspoon ground coriander</li>
            
            <li>½ teaspoon ground turmeric</li>
            
            <li>½ teaspoon Kashmiri red chili powder</li>
            
            <li>4 tomatoes, pureed</li>
            
            <li>½ pound paneer, cubed</li>
            
            <li>¼ cup water</li>
            
            <li>1 teaspoon white sugar</li>
            
            <li>salt to taste</li>
            
            <li>¼ cup cream</li>
            
            <li> 2 tablespoons chopped fresh cilantro</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium heat. 
            Cook the onion and garlic in the hot oil until the onions are soft and golden brown, about 5 minutes. <br>
            Sprinkle the cumin, coriander, turmeric, and chili powder over the onion and garlic; 
            continue cooking until the seasonings are fragrant, about 30 seconds.
        </li>
        <li>
            Pour the pureed tomatoes into the skillet; 
            cook until the excess liquid evaporates and the oil separates, 3 to 5 minutes. 
            Add the paneer, water, sugar, and salt to the mixture; stir gently so the paneer does not break apart.<br> 
            Cook until the paneer begins to absorb some of the liquid, about 10 minutes. 
            Stir the cream into the mixture and simmer another 5 minutes. Garnish with cilantro to serve.
        </li>
    </ol>
